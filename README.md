# Enviromental Sound Classification 
The goal of this project was to develop a machine learning model that can classify different types of environmental sounds. We used sound clips from the **UrbanSound8K dataset** and trained a **convolutional neural network (CNN)** for sound identification.

The project uses **TensorFlow and Keras** to develop a deep learning model for classifying different environmental sounds. While Keras performed well, no PyTorch implementation was included. The following sections will focus on building the sound classification model using **Keras**.
## Topics
1. Data Preprocessing 
2. Digital Signal Processing (Log-Mel Spectrograms)
3. Convolutional Neural Networks
4. Sound Classification
## Technologies
1. Python
2. Colab
3. TensorFlow,Keras
4. MNumpy, Panda, Matplotlib, Librosa
5. CNN.
## Dataset
UrbanSound8K
The **Results** section presents an analysis based on **10-fold cross-validation**. The model, built using **Keras**, achieved an accuracy of **--%** and a loss of **--** on the **UrbanSound8K dataset**.
"This dataset contains 8732 labeled sound excerpts (<=4s) of urban sounds from 10 classes:

  1. air_conditioner,
  2. car_horn,
  3. children_playing,
  4. dog_bark,
  5. drilling,
  6. enginge_idling,
  7. gun_shot,
  8. jackhammer,
  9. siren and
  10. street_music

  In addition to the sound excerpts, a CSV file containing metadata about each excerpt is also provided.
